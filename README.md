It's just a console app we have here.
I'm on my way to develop deskop and mobile apps. We are just at the starting point.
To view codes, to straight to "src" folder, then enter into ReportCardSystem to view the acutal files that contains the code used in the development of the app.
The files are: Main.java, Student.java and Subject.java
